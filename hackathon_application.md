CNN Article Generator - Ruby on Rails
I recently created a CNN article generator on my own. Basically the idea is you can create your own CNN articles (that look like those of the accredited news source CNN) and share them as needed. You can specify the headline, the author, the date, and the content of the article. Furthermore, you can insert pictures or links and even format text (bold, italics, etc.). It was my first Ruby on Rails application which I used to get the hang of things and was used for TechMUN (a Model United Nations Conference at my school) in three committees to give fake press releases to the delegates for the fictitious events transpiring in their committee. You can find it on github (https://github.com/2016rshah/article-generator) or make your own articles (http://cnn.rshah.io/).

Pynt - Javascript
During YHack we created Pynt which gives users the ability to draw Python code. Using vector based image recognition, Pynt lets users create classes, instantiate objects, and prototype code easily. The user draws shapes on a tablet and the converted code will appear on a desktop automatically. Although it translates the drawings into Python code, it was written as a web-app with Meteor. You can check it out on github at https://github.com/Pynt/Pynt

The MITRE Corporation Internship - Python
While I interned at the MITRE Corporation I created a natural language processing system for over 12,000 air traffic controller transmissions in Python. I also formulated four different "call-sign" identification algorithms and ran benchmark tests on each of them for the automatic speech recognition engine.

SpaceBowl - C#
During the last Hack the North I was a part of the team that created SpaceBowl (a virtual reality bowling game with the Myo and Oculus Rift). The hack won top 10 and the BackTrack API prize. More info is on challengepost: http://challengepost.com/software/spacebowl-oculus-myo
